BEGIN MAGIC LEAP ADBUCTOR NOTICES

This listing provides notice and guidance regarding the indicated items and should not be construed as an admission that the listed component appears in the distribution or in the manner indicated.  For example, the listing may include various dependencies applicable only to development, testing, and evaluation, which may not be included in the distribution and, indeed, may have been deprecated in favor of alternatives.  Similarly, fulfilling a licensee’s compliance requirements for a particular form of distribution is not an admission that the software is in fact distributed in that form.  For example, some dependencies may be dual-licensed and may permit redistribution under different licenses.  Distributions and packaging vary and not all third party components are relied upon in the same manner or degree. The presence of a dependency under a given header below is merely for organizational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the relevant, or elected, license.  Where dependency authors provided incomplete or inconsistent documentation, inferences have been made with the intention of giving effect to the dependency author’s desired intent.  Note that some compliance documentation may be found in the software itself.  For dependencies appearing in this product, that require access to source code materials, if an offer is not stated below, you may contact Magic Leap directly to receive the materials required under that license.  Note that where identical license documentation appears in multiple locations of the dependency source code, the documentation may have been presented below only once to facilitate concision.
